During the migration process, the Nautilus DevOps team created several EC2 instances in different regions. They are currently in the process of identifying the correct resources and utilization and are making continuous changes to ensure optimal resource utilization. Recently, they discovered that one of the EC2 instances was underutilized, prompting them to decide to change the instance type. Please make sure the Status check is completed (if it's still in Initializing state) before making any changes to the instance.

Change the instance type from t2.micro to t2.nano for nautilus-ec2 instance using terraform.

Make sure the EC2 instance nautilus-ec2 is in running state after the change.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to change the instance type.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.91.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.91.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
